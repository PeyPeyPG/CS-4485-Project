- **Patients ↔ Medications:** Via PatientMedications.
- **Patients ↔ MedicalConditions / Allergies:** Direct relation.
- **Providers ↔ DoctorsNotes:** Providers author notes for patients.
- **ActivityLog:** Logs every user's actions for traceability.

---

### **Typical Use Cases**
- Track patient demographics, medical conditions, allergies, medications, and provider relationships.
- Providers can author notes and manage patient information.
- System can generate logs for compliance and auditing purposes.
- Access rights between patients and providers are controlled.
